This project aims to provide a Java wrapper to the StackOverflow API.

### Getting Started ###
There are two interfaces to the library.
  1. [Query Interface](QueryAPI.md)
  1. [Facade Interface](FacadeAPI.md)

For complete stand-alone examples see [Examples Source](http://code.google.com/p/stackoverflow-java-sdk/source/browse/#hg/core/src/examples).

### Asynchronous API ###
Examples of using the API asynchronously are described in [Asynchronous API](AsynchronousAPI.md).

### Advanced Usage ###
Advanced usage like changing API providers or paging through the results are described in [Advanced Usage](AdvancedUsage.md).

### Spring Configuration ###
If you plan to use the library in conjunction with Spring framework, this brief tutorial will guide you. [Spring Configuration](SpringConfiguration.md)

### API Design ###
A brief design of the API is described here. [API Design](APIDesign.md).
